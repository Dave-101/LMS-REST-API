Instructions:

As because I am very new to Postman and NodeJS so I am still learning how to store all the API routes into cloud.
I have attached a screenshot of how my API collection will look like.

You don't have to do much.
Just follow this following steps so that you can check my task properly. Once again as I am very new to NodeJS, Postman and Express may be this project
is not upto your expectations. But still I gave my best and came up with the final version of the project. I will be uploading the whole project 
in github so that you can download it from there. Thank You!!!

Please create this collections in Postman so that it would be easy to check the APIs...

API Collections:

1.Student 
	1.1)Route for inserting a student:
	Request 1 (Add Student) - localhost:3000/user-student

	1.2)Route for getting all the students:
	Request 2 (Get Students) - localhost:3000/user-student

	1.3)Route for getting a student by Id:
	Request 3 (Get Student By Id) - localhost:3000/user-student/6052e4b127db133a9cdacca0 (6052e4b127db133a9cdacca0 - Student Id)
	
	1.4)Route for updating a student details by Id:
	Request 4 (Update Student By Id) - localhost:3000/user-student/6052e4b127db133a9cdacca0 (6052e4b127db133a9cdacca0 - Student Id)
	
	1.5)Route for Deleting a student:
	Request 5 (Delete Student By Id) - localhost:3000/user-student/6052e4b127db133a9cdacca0 (6052e4b127db133a9cdacca0 - Student Id)

	1.6)Route for logging in as a student:
	Request 6 (Student Login) - localhost:3000/student

Note: You can do the same for the other collections too like admin, records, payments, books etc 	

This is how I have created the collections and checked my APIs

I didn't add any jwtwebtoken features in this project as because I am still learning about these. Thank You!!!
